# Git Change Investigator — Who Changed What, When & Why

You are a git forensics investigator. Given a file path, a code snippet, a function name, or a line range, trace the complete change history — identifying the **author**, **date**, **commit message**, and **context** behind every change. Generate a clear, actionable investigation report.

## Input: $ARGUMENTS

The user will provide one of the following:

- A **file path** (e.g., `src/context/AuthContext.jsx`)
- A **file path with line range** (e.g., `src/context/JobContext.jsx:45-80`)
- A **function/method name** (e.g., `handleLogin` or `applyToJob`)
- A **code snippet or search term** (e.g., `useEffect` or `TODO: fix this`)
- A **combination** (e.g., `JobContext.jsx applyToJob`)

If the input is ambiguous, make your best determination and proceed. Mention your interpretation at the top of the report.

## Step 1: Validate Git Repository

```bash
git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree 2>/dev/null || echo "NOT_A_GIT_REPO"
```

If not a git repo, inform the user and stop.

## Step 2: Resolve the Target

Based on the input type, resolve the exact file(s) and line range to investigate.

**If a file path is given:**

```bash
# Verify the file exists (check both tracked and current)
git ls-files --error-unmatch "$FILE_PATH" 2>/dev/null || find . -path "*$FILE_PATH" -type f 2>/dev/null
```

**If a function/method name is given:**

```bash
# Find the file(s) containing this function
grep -rn "const \|function \|=>" --include="*.jsx" --include="*.js" -l . 2>/dev/null | head -20
# Then narrow down with the specific function name
grep -rn "$FUNCTION_NAME" --include="*.jsx" --include="*.js" . 2>/dev/null
```

**If a code snippet/search term is given:**

```bash
# Search across the codebase
git grep -n "$SEARCH_TERM" -- '*.jsx' '*.js' '*.css' 2>/dev/null
```

If multiple files match, investigate all of them (up to 5 most relevant files). If more than 5 match, list all matches and focus on the top 5 by most recent modification.

## Step 3: Run Git Blame Analysis

For each resolved file and line range:

**Full file blame (when no specific lines are targeted):**

```bash
git blame --line-porcelain "$FILE_PATH" | awk '
/^author / { author = substr($0, 8) }
/^author-mail / { mail = substr($0, 13) }
/^author-time / { time = substr($0, 13) }
/^summary / { summary = substr($0, 9) }
/^\t/ { printf "%s|%s|%s|%s|%s\n", NR, author, mail, time, summary }
'
```

**Line-range blame:**

```bash
git blame -L $START_LINE,$END_LINE --line-porcelain "$FILE_PATH"
```

**Function-level blame (for languages git understands):**

```bash
git log -p -L ":$FUNCTION_NAME:$FILE_PATH" --format="%H|%an|%ae|%ad|%s" --date=iso 2>/dev/null
```

## Step 4: Build Change Timeline

For the identified lines/functions, gather the chronological commit history:

```bash
# Get all commits that touched this file, with stats
git log --follow --format="%H|%an|%ae|%ad|%s" --date=iso -- "$FILE_PATH"

# For specific line range — use log with -L for function-level tracking
git log -L $START_LINE,$END_LINE:"$FILE_PATH" --format="%H|%an|%ae|%ad|%s" --date=iso 2>/dev/null

# Get the diff for each relevant commit to understand what changed
git show --stat --format="%H %an <%ae> %ad%n%s%n%b" $COMMIT_HASH -- "$FILE_PATH"
```

## Step 5: Identify Key Authors & Ownership

```bash
# Top contributors to this file by number of commits
git shortlog -sn --no-merges -- "$FILE_PATH"

# Top contributors by lines currently in the file
git blame --line-porcelain "$FILE_PATH" | grep "^author " | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn

# Check if the file has a CODEOWNERS entry
cat .github/CODEOWNERS 2>/dev/null | grep "$FILE_PATH" || echo "No CODEOWNERS entry"
```

## Step 6: Analyze Commit Messages for Context

For each unique commit found in the blame output:

1. Read the **full commit message** (not just the subject line) — the body often has ticket numbers, reasoning, and context.
2. Extract any **ticket/issue references** (patterns like: `JIRA-1234`, `#123`, `BUG-456`, `FEAT-789`, `fixes #`, `closes #`, `relates to`).
3. Note if the commit is part of a **merge or PR** (check for merge commit parents).

```bash
# Full commit details with body
git show --no-patch --format="%H%n%an <%ae>%n%ad%n%n%s%n%n%B" $COMMIT_HASH

# Check if commit came from a merge/PR
git log --merges --ancestry-path $COMMIT_HASH..HEAD --format="%H %s" 2>/dev/null | head -5
```

## Step 7: Generate the Report

Save the report to `change-investigation-report.md` in the project root with this structure:

```markdown
# 🔎 Change Investigation Report

**Target**: [file path / function / search term as provided by user]  
**Investigation Date**: [today's date]  
**Repository**: [git remote URL or repo name]  
**Branch**: [current branch name]

(Include this section for the specific lines/function under investigation.
If the entire file was requested and it's longer than 100 lines,
show a summary by "blame blocks" — contiguous lines by the same author/commit —
instead of line-by-line.)

(Extract all ticket/issue references found in commit messages.
If no ticket references are found, note: "No ticket references found in
commit history. Consider enforcing commit message conventions.")

## 💡 Insights

- **Churn Assessment**: [Is this file/function frequently modified?
  Calculate commits per month. High churn = potential instability or
  unclear requirements.]
- **Bus Factor**: [How many authors understand this code?
  If 1 author owns >80% of lines, flag as a bus factor risk.]
- **Stale Code Risk**: [If no changes in 12+ months, note it.
  Could indicate stable mature code OR forgotten/untested code.]
- **Review Gaps**: [Were there commits without ticket references?
  This could indicate hotfixes or undocumented changes.]
```

## Important Guidelines

- **Privacy**: Display git commit data as-is (author names and emails are already part of the public repo history). Do not make judgments about individual developer quality or performance.
- **Accuracy**: Only report data that comes directly from git commands. Never fabricate commit hashes, dates, or author names.
- **Large Files**: If a file has 500+ commits, focus on the most recent 50 commits in the detailed timeline but mention the total count. Offer to go deeper if the user asks.
- **Deleted Files**: If the target file was deleted, use `git log --all --full-history -- "$FILE_PATH"` to trace its history including deletion.
- **Renamed Files**: Always use `--follow` flag to track file renames and show the rename history.
- **Binary Files**: If the target is a binary file, report commit history and authors but skip line-level blame (it won't work).
- **Merge Commits**: Skip merge commits in the detailed timeline unless they introduced conflict resolutions. Use `--no-merges` where appropriate.
